There are 14 different weapon variables in which you may alter.

Firing Variables:
Firing Force allows you to alter the force at which the projectile is fired.
Shots Per Second allows you to alter the rate at which the projectiles are fired.
Projectile is the ammunition type, this can be altered by passing it a different GameObeject Prefab.
Firing Point is the point at which the projectile is instantiated, the Firing Point requires a Transform.
Fire State is the state of the weapon, there are currently two states, automatic and semi-automatic.
 - automatic fires projectiles continuously whilst the fire key is pressed.
 - semi-automatic only fires a projectile when the fire input key is pressed without previous input.

Bullet Spread Variables
Bullet Spread displays the current spread of the projectiles.
Min Bullet Spread is the minium amount of spread between the projectiles.
Max Bullet Spread is the maximum amount of spread between the projectiles.
Recoil is the amount in which the Bullet Spread variable increases per shot.
Recoil Stablistation is the speed in which the Bullet Spread Variable decreases over time.

Ammo Variables
Ammo is the curret ammo of the clip, this is clamped by the clip size. Altering this allows you to change the guns starting ammo.
Ammo Pool is the amount of ammo you can reload.
Clip Size effects the amount of bullets the gun can hold between before reloading.
